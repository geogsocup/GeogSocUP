                		The <b>Geographic Society of the University of the Philippines</b>, also known as <b>UP GeogSoc</b> (formerly abbreviated as <b>GSUP</b>), is a college-based, non-profit and non-partisan academic student organization. It was founded on <b>02 February 1963</b> as <i>The Geographic Society University of the Philippines</i> by <b>Ricardo S. Domingo, Jr.</b> along with 49 other B.S. Geography, B. Education, B.S. Foreign Service, and other undergraduate students at the UP Diliman College of Arts and Sciences under the Department of Geology and Geography. Ricardo S. Domingo, Jr. also served as the organization’s first president. For a time, during the 1990s, the organization was also once known as <i>The Geographical Society of U.P.</i>
                		</p>
						<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">UP GeogSoc is composed of individuals who are driven together by the passion of making Geography a better-known discipline in the country and 
						developing the practice of geographic inquiry, particularly in the Philippine context. 
						It is guided by four main principles: <b>academic excellence</b>, <b>camaraderie</b>, <b>service</b>, and <b>advocacy</b>.

                		<h4 class="section-heading">Early Era (1963 - 1972)</h4>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		During the early years of the organization in the 1960s, the UP GeogSoc membership primarily comprised students pursuing A.B. Political Science, B. Education, and B.S. Foreign Service degrees, with Geography majors forming a minority within the organization. UP GeogSoc was initially a social club for Geography majors and enthusiasts during its formative years, but has since evolved to become an academic organization that places emphasis on scholastic excellence, camaraderie amongst its members, and the desire to teach and integrate Geography to the country’s school curriculum. The latter is emphasized by the fact that B. Education majors formed a large part of the membership of UP GeogSoc during its early years.
                		</p>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		UP GeogSoc’s first faculty adviser was Dr. Domingo C. Salita, who was also the first professor of Geography to serve as the chairperson of the UP Department of Geology and Geography, and one of the pioneers of the discipline of Geography in the country. Dr. Telesforo W. Luna, Jr., also one of the pioneers of Geography in the country, also served as one of UP GeogSoc's original advisers. Dr. Luna assumed the role during the second semesters of each academic year from 1964 to 1970, while Dr. Salita fulfilled the advisory position during the first semesters from 1963 to 1970. Then, from 1970 to 1972, Dr. Salita continued to serve as the sole adviser for both the first and second semesters. 
                		</p>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		UP GeogSoc's early organizational activities include academic discussions about geographic topics, field trips, social acquaintance parties, and fellowship activities among its members. Additionally, during this period, UP GeogSoc published an annual geographic journal titled <i>The Landscape</i>.

                		<h4 class="section-heading">Martial Law Period (1972 - 1980)</h4>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In 1972, after only 9 years of existence, UP GeogSoc, along with the other student organizations in UP during that time, was forced to suspend its activities due to the declaration of Martial Law and the ban on student organizations. Although faced with the threat and repression brought on by Martial Law at the time, the organization continued to accept members and operated clandestinely as a refuge for Geography majors.

                		<h4 class="section-heading">Revival and Relocation to CSSP (1980 - 1995)</h4>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		UP GeogSoc was revived and its activities resumed on 03 February 1980 after 8 years of inactivity under the leadership of Darlene Occeña-Gutierrez, who became the organization’s fifth president from 1980 to 1983. She received guidance and mentorship from Liberty C. Tabigne, the organization's second president and a faculty member of the Geography department at that time. Liberty Tabigne also assumed the role of adviser for UP GeogSoc from 1980 to 1984, after which, Dr. Telesforo W. Luna, Jr. returned for his second stint as adviser from 1984 to 1995 while concurrently serving as the chairperson of the UP Department of Geography during those years. Dr. Luna’s role as the adviser stands as the longest in the organization's history, spanning 17 years in two separate periods. 
                		</p>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		On 26 October 1983, the College of Arts and Sciences was divided into three separate colleges - the College of Arts and Letters (CAL), College of Social Sciences and Philosophy (CSSP), and College of Science (CS). This division, mandated by Administrative Order No. 170 from the UP Board of Regents, resulted in the split of the Department of Geology and Geography, with the Geology section becoming the National Institute of Geological Sciences under the College of Science, and the Geography section becoming a distinct department under CSSP. UP GeogSoc continued its programs and expanded its membership under the newly created Department of Geography, and since then has been based in CSSP.
                		</p>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In 1990, UP GeogSoc introduced a new logo design, replacing the original one that had been used since the organization's establishment. The new logo showcases a globe centered on the Philippines, accompanied by eight rays symbolizing the cardinal and ordinal directions. A banderole bearing the organization's name is wrapped around the rays. This logo was used from 1990 to 2010.
                		</p>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		Since the formation of the CSSP Student Council in the mid 1980s, UP GeogSoc has actively encouraged its dedicated members to run for the Geography Department Representative position. The first recorded Geography Department Representative was Bernadette F. San Juan, who was elected to the position in 1988, running under the Nagkaisang Tugon-CSSP slate. Notably, during this period, the Department of Geography had the smallest undergraduate population among all the departments in CSSP, with an average of no more than 70 students annually from the 1980s until the late 1990s. Due to this circumstance, if no other UP GeogSoc member decided to run, it became obligatory for the incoming UP GeogSoc president to simultaneously run for the Geography Department Representative position at the CSSP Student Council. This stemmed from the fact that UP GeogSoc provided automatic membership to all Geography undergraduates during that time, making all Geography undergraduates members of UP GeogSoc, thus making the president the representative of all Geography majors.
                		</p>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In cases where no candidates ran for the position during the elections, the CSSP Student Council would appoint the incumbent UP GeogSoc president to assume the role of Geography Department Representative. This ensured continuity and representation for the department within the student council. This practice continued from 1989 until 1999. Noehl Alvena L. Dalao, the organization's eleventh president, became the first UP GeogSoc President to simultaneously hold the Geography Department Representative position, being appointed to the position in 1989 by the CSSP Student Council with the recommendation of the Geography majors and members of UP GeogSoc. Later, Trina C. Galido-Isorena became the first UP GeogSoc president to run under a slate during the council elections and be elected by popular vote to become the Geography Department Representative. She ran as a candidate under the ISA-Buklod CSSP slate and was elected in 1993.

                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		UP GeogSoc continued to operate uninterruptedly until 1995 when it experienced a brief hiatus  for two years following the graduation of the members of its Executive Committee in that year, and was further exacerbated by a decline in the number of enrolled Geography majors during that period.

                		<h4 class="section-heading">Second Revival and Renaissance (1997 - 2010)</h4>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In 1997, Jonas Gaffud spearheaded the resumption of the organization’s activities and was elected as the 17th president of the organization. Under his leadership, activities and recruitment of new members for the organization resumed and gained momentum. During this period, the organization briefly adopted the name "The Geographical Society of U.P.," but reverted back to its original name in 2000. Under Jonas Gaffud's leadership, UP GeogSoc organized various activities, including the notable "Where in the World? Quiz Show."  In less than a year, the organization regained its dominant position as the only undergraduate organization in the Department of Geography.

                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In 2009, Sarah Mariz "Sasa" de Vega, a member of UP GeogSoc, made history by becoming the first Geography major to be elected as Vice Chairperson at the CSSP Student Council, running under BUKLOD CSSP.

                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In 2010, under Hanie Sanchez’s presidency, the two flagship events of UP GeogSoc--namely Geog Ride and the Philippine Geography Olympiad (PGO)--were established and held for the first time. 
                		</p>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		UP GeogSoc further introduced a new logo with a simple, sleek, and contemporary design. The logo prominently showcases a double chevron shape in the colors blue, white, and green, and has since become the organization's official logo.
                		</p>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		UP GeogSoc experienced an increase in membership, interest, and participation from students who were drawn to the new activities and initiatives it offered. Over the next decade, UP GeogSoc regained its position as the predominant student organization within the Department of Geography, with more than half of the Geography majors being affiliated with UP GeogSoc every year.

                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In February 2012, the Alumni Association of the Geographic Society of the University of the Philippines Inc. (GSUP Alumni Inc.) was formally registered in the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish an association that would maintain connections among the UP GeogSoc Alumni Members. The following December, GSUP Alumni Inc. was recognized as an Organization-Based Chapter of the University of the Philippines Alumni Association (UPAA).

                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In February 2018, UP GeogSoc officially became a student branch of the International Association of Young Geographers (IAYG) and became the first and only student branch of IAYG in the Philippines. It is also the largest student branch of IAYG in Southeast Asia.

                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In May 2020, during Jacob Jacela's presidency, UP GeogSoc amended its constitution to modernize its organizational structure, internal processes, and membership rules. The amendment aimed to facilitate innovation and accommodate new ideas within the organization. The constitutional amendment has also codified “UP GeogSoc” as the official abbreviation of the organization, replacing the abbreviation “GSUP” while still recognizing its historic significance and sentimental value. This change was discussed and decided by the resident members of the organization during a General Assembly held in the Academic Year 2019-2020, with the intention of enhancing the organization's visibility beyond CSSP and attracting members from outside the Department of Geography.
                		</p>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In October 2020, UP GeogSoc garnered prominence, national attention, and media coverage when its open letter to DENR Undersecretary Benny Antiporda gained widespread viral traction on social media. The letter condemned Antiporda's comments directed at the UP Marine Science Institute and demanded his resignation. The public response to the letter was largely positive, further raising the organization's profile under the leadership of its 41st president, Jael Gonzales. 
                		</p>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the transition to virtual learning, UP GeogSoc successfully adapted its activities to an online format. While the Geog Ride was an exception due to its nature as an outdoor event, the organization was able to hold its events such as ACLEs (Alternative Classroom Learning Experience) and PERSPECTIVE: The Geography Forum Series in a fully virtual and online format. Notably, UP GeogSoc managed to conduct all planned events without any cancellations during the height of the pandemic. Additionally, the 11th and 12th editions of the Philippine Geography Olympiad, held in 2022 and 2023 respectively, were also successfully conducted in an online and virtual setup. The absence of a physical <i>tambayan</i> did not hinder the camaraderie among UP GeogSoc members. During the pandemic, the resident members of UP GeogSoc utilized the Discord platform as an e-tambayan, serving as an online safe space when it was not yet possible to return to the physical tambayan.

On 11 February 2023, UP GeogSoc held a homecoming party for its resident members and alumni. It was the organization’s first major face-to-face event since the pandemic.

                		On 27 February 2023, the Geographic Society of the University of the Philippines launched its new flagship event entitled, “MAPAaralan: Geography for Kids” which aims to teach children basic geographical concepts in a very fun and comprehensible way appropriate for their age. On its launch, UP GeogSoc partnered with Kalinga Day Care Center. The program was filled with different activities about landform modeling, making simple maps, and activities teaching basic spatial concepts which would be useful to the children as they continue to explore their environment. MAPAaralan: Geography for Kids was one of the first major face-to-face events spearheaded by the organization after three years of conducting activities and programs online because of the pandemic. On 25 April 2023, UP GeogSoc held its first face-to-face ACLE entitled “Para! Para Kanino ang Kalsada? The Mobilities of Pedestrians, Cyclists, and PWD.” It attracted a large attendance of over 90 participants, one of the largest number of participants for an ACLE.

                		On 24 May 2023, Francesca Duran, a member of UP GeogSoc, achieved a significant milestone by making history as the first Chairperson from the Geography department to be elected to the position at the CSSP Student Council. She ran under the SALiGAN sa CSSP slate. Prior to her election, she held the position of Vice President for Internal Affairs within the organization during the academic year 2021-2022. Additionally, she served as the Chairperson of the 12th Philippine Geography Olympiad.

                		In July 2023, yet another milestone was reached by one of UP GeogSoc’s members. Rey Edward Dimacuha, UP GeogSoc President during A.Y. 2022 - 2023 and OIC for Academics and Research during the 2nd semester of A.Y. 2021 - 2022 became the fourth Summa Cum Laude of the Department of Geography and the third from UP GeogSoc.

                		On 10 October 2023, UP GeogSoc was recognized by the Department of Science and Technology Science Education Institute (DOST-SEI) at the the Media Conference Presentation of the 2023 Philippine Teams in International STEM Olympiads for its contribution to advancing excellence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), particularly in the field of Geography, among Filipino students. This recognition was conferred in light of UP GeogSoc's efforts in organizing the Philippine Geography Olympiad (PGO). UP GeogSoc was also acknowledged as the official organizer of PGO by the DOST-SEI. Moreover, PGO was also officially endorsed by the DOST-SEI as one of the country’s official STEM Olympiads.
