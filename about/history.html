                		The <b>Geographic Society of the University of the Philippines</b>, also known as <b>UP GeogSoc</b> (formerly abbreviated as <b>GSUP</b>), is a college-based, non-profit and non-partisan academic organization. It was founded on <b>02 February 1963</b> as <i>The Geographic Society University of the Philippines</i> by <b>Ricardo S. Domingo, Jr.</b> along with 49 other B.S. Geography, B.S. Foreign Service, and A.B. Political Science students at the UP Diliman College of Arts and Sciences under the Department of Geology and Geography. Ricardo S. Domingo, Jr. also served as the organization’s first president. For a time, during the 1990s, the organization was also once known as <i>The Geographical Society of U.P.</i>
                		</p>
						<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">UP GeogSoc is composed of individuals who are driven together by the passion of making Geography a better-known discipline in the country and 
						developing the practice of geographic inquiry, particularly in the Philippine context. 
						It is guided by four main principles: <b>academic excellence</b>, <b>camaraderie</b>, <b>service</b>, and <b>advocacy</b>.   	
                		</p>
                		<br>
                		<h4 class="section-heading">Early Era (1963 - 1972)</h4>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		During the early years of the organization in the 1960s, the UP GeogSoc membership primarily comprised students pursuing A.B. Political Science and B.S. Foreign Service degrees, with Geography majors forming a minority within the organization. UP GeogSoc was initially a social club for Geography majors and enthusiasts during its formative years, but has since evolved to become an academic organization that places emphasis on scholastic performance and camaraderie amongst its members. 
                		</p>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		UP GeogSoc’s first faculty adviser was Dr. Domingo C. Salita, who was also the first professor of Geography to serve as the chairperson of the UP Department of Geology and Geography, and one of the pioneers of the discipline of Geography in the country. Dr. Telesforo W. Luna, Jr., also one of the pioneers of Geography in the country, also served as one of UP GeogSoc's original advisers. Dr. Luna assumed the role during the second semesters of each academic year from 1964 to 1970, while Dr. Salita fulfilled the advisory position during the first semesters from 1963 to 1972. Dr. Luna’s tenure as adviser stands as the longest in the organization's history, spanning 17 years. Initially serving as adviser from 1964 to 1970, he later resumed the position from 1984 to 1995 while concurrently serving as the chairperson of the UP Department of Geography during those years. 
                		</p>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		UP GeogSoc's early organizational activities include academic discussions about geographic topics, field trips, social acquaintance parties, and fellowship activities among its members.

                		<h4 class="section-heading">Martial Law Period (1972 - 1980)</h4>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In 1972, after only 9 years of existence, UP GeogSoc, along with the other student organizations in UP during that time, was forced to suspend its activities due to the declaration of Martial Law and the ban on student organizations. Although faced with the threat and repression brought on by Martial Law at the time, the organization continued to accept members and operated clandestinely as a refuge for Geography majors.
                		</p>
                		<br>
                		<h4 class="section-heading">Revival and Relocation to CSSP (1980 - 1995)</h4>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		UP GeogSoc was revived and its activities resumed in 1980 after 8 years of inactivity under the leadership of Darlene Occeña-Gutierrez, who became the organization’s fifth president from 1980 to 1983. She received guidance and mentorship from Liberty C. Tabigne, the organization's second president and a faculty member of the Geography department at that time. Liberty Tabigne also assumed the role of adviser for UP GeogSoc from 1980 to 1984. 
                		</p>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		On 26 October 1983, the College of Arts and Sciences was divided into three separate colleges - the College of Arts and Letters (CAL), College of Social Sciences and Philosophy (CSSP), and College of Science (CS). This division, mandated by Administrative Order No. 170 from the UP Board of Regents, resulted in the split of the Department of Geology and Geography, with the Geology section becoming the National Institute of Geological Studies under the College of Science, and the Geography section becoming a distinct department under CSSP. UP GeogSoc continued its programs and expanded its membership under the newly created Department of Geography, and since then has been based in CSSP.
                		</p>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In 1990, a new design for UP GeogSoc’s logo was introduced, replacing the first one which was used since the organization’s foundation. This logo was used from 1990 to 2010.
                		</p>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		Upon the creation of the Department Representatives position at the recently formed CSSP Student Council in 1990, it became customary for the UP GeogSoc president to automatically be nominated as the Geography Department Representative. This practice continued until 1999. Theodore SJ. Honorio, the organization's twelfth president, became the first Geography Department Representative, being appointed to the position by the CSSP Student Council with the recommendation of the Geography majors and members of UP GeogSoc. Later, Juanito G. Berja, Jr. made history as the first-ever elected Geography Department representative and third overall to hold the position. He ran as a candidate under the ISA-Buklod CSSP slate and was elected to the position through popular vote in 1992.

                		<h4 class="section-heading">Brief Hiatus (1995 - 1997)</h4>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		UP GeogSoc continued to operate uninterruptedly until 1995 when it experienced a brief hiatus  for two years following the graduation of the members of its Executive Committee in that year, and was further exacerbated by a decline in the number of enrolled Geography majors during that period.
                		</p>
                		<br>
                		<h4 class="section-heading">Second Revival and Renaissance (1997 - 2010)</h4>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In 1997, Jonas Gaffud was elected as the 17th president of the organization. Under his leadership, activities and recruitment of new members for the organization resumed and gained momentum. During this period, the organization temporarily adopted the name "The Geographical Society of U.P.," but reverted back to its original name in 1999. Under Jonas Gaffud's leadership, UP GeogSoc organized various activities, including the notable "Where in the World? Quiz Show."  In less than a year, the organization regained its dominant position as the only undergraduate organization in the Department of Geography.
                		</p>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In 2009, UP GeogSoc member Sarah Mariz "Sasa" de Vega made history as the first Vice Chairperson at the CSSP Student Council from the Geography department to be elected to the position, running under BUKLOD CSSP.

                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In 2010, under Hanie Sanchez’s presidency, the two flagship events of UP GeogSoc--namely Geog Ride and the Philippine Geography Olympiad (PGO)--were established and held for the first time. UP GeogSoc also introduced a new logo with a simple yet modern design, which has become the official logo used by the organization to this day. UP GeogSoc experienced an increase in membership, interest, and participation from students who were drawn to the new activities and initiatives it offered. Over the next decade, UP GeogSoc regained its position as the predominant student organization within the Department of Geography, with more than half of the Geography majors being affiliated with UP GeogSoc every year.

                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In February 2012, the Alumni Association of the Geographic Society of the University of the Philippines Inc. (GSUP Alumni Inc.) was formally registered in the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish an association that would maintain connections among the UP GeogSoc Alumni Members. The following December, GSUP Alumni Inc. was recognized as an Organization-Based Chapter of the University of the Philippines Alumni Association (UPAA).

                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In 2015, GSUPERSPECTIVE: The Forum Series (currently branded as PERSPECTIVE: The Geography Forum Series) was established to expand horizons of geographic thinking and perspective in society’s most critical and most talked-about issues.
                		</p>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In February 2018, UP GeogSoc officially became a student branch of the International Association of Young Geographers (IAYG) and became the first and only student branch of IAYG in the Philippines. It is also the largest student branch of IAYG in Southeast Asia.

                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		On March 9, 2020, just after the conclusion of the 10th Philippine Geography Olympiad, the organization's on-ground activities were suspended due to the nationwide state of public health emergency declared in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In May 2020, during Jacob Jacela's presidency, UP GeogSoc amended its constitution to modernize its organizational structure, internal processes, and membership rules. The amendment aimed to facilitate innovation and accommodate new ideas within the organization. The constitutional amendment has also codified “UP GeogSoc” as the official abbreviation of the organization, replacing the abbreviation “GSUP” while still recognizing its historic significance and sentimental value. This change was discussed and decided by the resident members of the organization during a General Assembly held in the Academic Year 2019-2020, with the intention of enhancing the organization's visibility beyond CSSP and attracting members from outside the Department of Geography.
                		</p>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In October 2020, upon the formation of a new executive committee headed by the organization’s 41st president, Jael Gonzales, UP GeogSoc made headlines, gained national prominence, and was featured in several news media outlets when its open letter to DENR undersecretary Benny Antiporda regarding his comments made against the UP Marine Science Institute went viral on social media.
                		</p>
                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the transition to virtual learning, UP GeogSoc successfully adapted its activities to an online format. While the Geog Ride was an exception due to its nature as an outdoor event, the organization was able to hold its events such as ACLEs (Alternative Classroom Learning Experience) and PERSPECTIVE: The Geography Forum Series in a fully virtual and online format. Notably, UP GeogSoc managed to conduct all planned events without any cancellations during the height of the pandemic. Additionally, the 11th and 12th editions of the Philippine Geography Olympiad, held in 2022 and 2023 respectively, were also successfully organized in an online and virtual setup.

                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		In February 2023, UP GeogSoc celebrated its 60th anniversary with a month-long series of events and activities. On 2 February 2023, the organization commemorated 60 years of its existence through a short video posted on its social media accounts. On 11 February 2023, UP GeogSoc held a homecoming party for its resident members and alumni. It was the organization’s first major face-to-face event since the pandemic.

                		<p class="text-muted text-justify text-content-standard">
                		On 27 February 2023, the Geographic Society of the University of the Philippines launched its new flagship event entitled, “MAPAaralan: Geography for Kids” which aims to teach children basic geographical concepts in a very fun and comprehensible way appropriate for their age. On its launch, UP GeogSoc partnered with Kalinga Day Care Center. The program was filled with different activities about landform modeling, making simple maps, and activities teaching basic spatial concepts which would be useful to the children as they continue to explore their environment. MAPAaralan: Geography for Kids was one of the first major face-to-face events spearheaded by the organization after three years of conducting activities and programs online because of the pandemic. On 25 April 2023, UP GeogSoc held its first face-to-face ACLE entitled “Para! Para Kanino ang Kalsada? The Mobilities of Pedestrians, Cyclists, and PWD.” It attracted a large attendance of over 90 participants, one of the largest number of participants for an ACLE.
